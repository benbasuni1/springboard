Intro
- Ben Basuni
    Software Engineer at DigitalML. Work with providing holistic API catalogs for Fortune 200 companies. Clients includes Wells Fargo, Bank of America, CNA, Mitsubishi Financial Group

Continously learning:
  * Reading O'Reilly book on Hands-On Machine Learning
  * On top of these 2 bootcamps, I completed 2 classes on ML and Python on Udemy. 
  * After this bootcamp will start thinking about competing in Kaggle and doing more EDA on things that I am interested in.
  * More focused on smaller scale information gathering projects, rather than large-scale ones, hence my project is something small but fruitful.
