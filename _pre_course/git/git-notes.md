"All Git commands are really just graph manipulation commands"

"Finally figuring out that git commands are strangely named graph manipulation commands -- creating/deleting nodes, moving pointers around"

"Git makes so much more sense when you understand how it really works, because it's really a two trick pony."

"A graph refers to a collection of nodes and a collection of edges that connect pairs of nodes."

### Git Remote
The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories.   
Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories.   
Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.
